## Abstract
This project applies multiclass classification to the UCI Abalone dataset to predict the sex of abalones (M, F, I) from simple physical measurements using the PyCaret library. After loading and preparing the data, I used PyCaret’s classification module with Sex as the target and 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Accuracy was chosen as the main evaluation metric because the three classes are relatively balanced and misclassification costs are similar. Among the compared models, logistic regression achieved the highest mean cross-validated accuracy (≈55.42%) when using all eight original features. Feature importance and correlation analysis showed that some variables were highly redundant (e.g., Length and Diameter, Shell_weight and weight-related features), so I removed Length, Shell_weight, and Rings and retrained the model on five non-redundant, high-importance features. The simplified logistic regression model reached 55.56% cross-validated accuracy and 54.15% accuracy on an unseen hold-out set, with only a small drop between training and test performance, suggesting good generalization and no serious overfitting. The final trained pipeline was saved as a reusable PyCaret model for future inference.
